    <p> My name is Aedan Frank and I am a second-year Game Design and Development Student. I am extremely interested in charachter development, creative writing as well as creating fun game mechanics and 3D modeling. I also wish to study musical composition as music is one of the most imprtant aspects of making a game cohesive and can greatly impact storytelling in any medium. I am also going into graduate school to get my masters in Business Administration with a focus on Marketing/Advertising. My end goal is to work in the video game industry and maybe even make my own game someday. In terms of this class I hope to learn how to design coherent visually appealing web pages that can function well on any platform and draw people in.</p>
